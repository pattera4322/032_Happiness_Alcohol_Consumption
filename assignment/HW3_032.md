# Assignment 3 (Group)
Explore 2 dataset that given then finding descriptive statistics and summary result in form of sentences/paragraph at least 5 topics.

### Answer

1.) The average weight of female cat's heart is 9.202128
```{R}
mean(cats$Hwt[cats$Sex == 'F'])

#use dplr
cats %>% filter(Sex == 'F') %>% dplyr::select(Hwt) %>% summarise(avg_Hwt = mean(Hwt, na.rm = T))
glimpse(cats)

#  9.202128
```

2.) The average weight of female cat's heart is 9.202128
```{R}
table(survey$Sex[survey$Smoke == 'Heavy'])

# use dplr
Smoke_Heavy = survey %>% filter(Smoke == 'Heavy')
table(Smoke_Heavy$Sex)

# female = 5, male = 6
```

7.) Difference in the heaviest body weight between male and female cats.
```{R}
maxBodyMCat <- max(cats$Bwt[cats$Sex == 'M']) 
maxBodyFCat <- max(cats$Bwt[cats$Sex == 'F']) 
maxBodyMCat - maxBodyFCat 

# use dplr
cats %>% group_by(Sex) %>% dplyr::select(Bwt,Sex) %>% summarise(max(Bwt, na.rm = TRUE))
  # F   3  
  # M   3.9
  # 0.9
```

9.) The number of students under the age of 18 that used to smoke is 12.
```{R}
StuNever <- sum(survey$Smoke[survey$Age < 18] == 'Never')
Student <- sum(survey$Age < 18)
Student - StuNever

# use dplr
length(survey %>% filter(Age < 18,!(Smoke == "Never")))
# 12
```
