# Assignment 3 (Group)
Explore 2 dataset that given then finding descriptive statistics and summary result in form of sentences/paragraph at least 5 topics.

### Answer

1.) The average weight of female cat's heart is 9.202128
```{R}
mean(cats$Hwt[cats$Sex == 'F'])

#use dplr
cats %>% filter(Sex == 'F') %>% dplyr::select(Hwt) %>% summarise(avg_Hwt = mean(Hwt, na.rm = T))
glimpse(cats)

#  9.202128
```

2.) The number of male students smoked heavy more than female students.
```{R}
table(survey$Sex[survey$Smoke == 'Heavy'])

# use dplr
Smoke_Heavy = survey %>% filter(Smoke == 'Heavy')
table(Smoke_Heavy$Sex)

# female = 5, male = 6
```

5.) From this information you will see that the value of average age of Female more than male but the value of average height of male is more than Female
```{R}
AvgMaleAge <- c(survey$Age[survey$Sex == 'Male'])
AMA <- mean(AvgMaleAge, na.rm = TRUE) #20.33196

AvgFemaleAge <- c(survey$Age[survey$Sex == 'Female'])
AFA <- mean(AvgFemaleAge, na.rm = TRUE) #20.40753

AvgMaleHeight <- c(survey$Height[survey$Sex == 'Male'])
AMH <- mean(AvgMaleHeight, na.rm = TRUE) #178.826

AvgFemaleHeight <- c(survey$Height[survey$Sex == 'Female'])
AFH <- mean(AvgFemaleHeight, na.rm = TRUE) #165.6867


#use dplyr
Avg_Male_Age <- survey %>% filter(Sex == 'Male') %>% dplyr::select(Age) %>% summarise(Avg_Male_Age = mean(Age, na.rm = T))
Avg_Female_Age <- survey %>% filter(Sex == 'Female') %>% dplyr::select(Age) %>% summarise(Avg_Female_Age = mean(Age, na.rm = T))
Avg_Male_Height <- survey %>% filter(Sex == 'Male') %>% dplyr::select(Height) %>% summarise(Avg_Male_Height = mean(Height, na.rm = T))
Avg_Female_Height <- survey %>% filter(Sex == 'Female') %>% dplyr::select(Height) %>% summarise(Avg_Female_Height = mean(Height, na.rm = T))

# Avg_Male_Age      <dbl> 20.33196
# Avg_Female_Age    <dbl> 20.40753
# Avg_Male_Height   <dbl> 178.826
# Avg_Female_Height <dbl> 165.6867
```

7.) Difference in the heaviest body weight between male and female cats.
```{R}
maxBodyMCat <- max(cats$Bwt[cats$Sex == 'M']) 
maxBodyFCat <- max(cats$Bwt[cats$Sex == 'F']) 
maxBodyMCat - maxBodyFCat 

# use dplr
cats %>% group_by(Sex) %>% dplyr::select(Bwt,Sex) %>% summarise(max(Bwt, na.rm = TRUE))
  # F   3  
  # M   3.9
  # 0.9
```

9.) The number of students under the age of 18 that used to smoke is 12.
```{R}
StuNever <- sum(survey$Smoke[survey$Age < 18] == 'Never')
Student <- sum(survey$Age < 18)
Student - StuNever

# use dplr
length(survey %>% filter(Age < 18,!(Smoke == "Never")))
# 12
```
